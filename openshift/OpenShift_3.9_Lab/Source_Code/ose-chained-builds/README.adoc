= Chained builds in openshift
Code for my Chained build blog in OpenShift 3

There is 3 examples:

* Using openshift/s2i-wildfly image as builder and jboss/wildfly as runtime image
* Using jorgemoralespou/s2i-java to build a gradle application and registry.access.redhat.com/redhat-openjdk-18/openjdk18-openshift to run it
* Using openshift-s2i/go to build your application and scratch to run it
