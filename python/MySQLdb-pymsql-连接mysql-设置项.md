        """
        Establish a connection to the MySQL database. Accepts several
        arguments:

        host: Host where the database server is located
        user: Username to log in as
        password: Password to use.
        database: Database to use, None to not use a particular one.
        port: MySQL port to use, default is usually OK. (default: 3306)
        bind_address: When the client has multiple network interfaces, specify
            the interface from which to connect to the host. Argument can be
            a hostname or an IP address.
        unix_socket: Optionally, you can use a unix socket rather than TCP/IP.
        charset: Charset you want to use.
        sql_mode: Default SQL_MODE to use.
        read_default_file:
            Specifies  my.cnf file to read these parameters from under the [client] section.
        conv:
            Conversion dictionary to use instead of the default one.
            This is used to provide custom marshalling and unmarshaling of types.
            See converters.
        use_unicode:
            Whether or not to default to unicode strings.
            This option defaults to true for Py3k.
        client_flag: Custom flags to send to MySQL. Find potential values in constants.CLIENT.
        cursorclass: Custom cursor class to use.
        init_command: Initial SQL statement to run when connection is established.
        connect_timeout: Timeout before throwing an exception when connecting.
            (default: 10, min: 1, max: 31536000) # 测试到2000000
        ssl:
            A dict of arguments similar to mysql_ssl_set()'s parameters.
            For now the capath and cipher arguments are not supported.
        read_default_group: Group to read from in the configuration file.
        compress; Not supported
        named_pipe: Not supported
        autocommit: Autocommit mode. None means use server default. (default: False)
        local_infile: Boolean to enable the use of LOAD DATA LOCAL command. (default: False)
        max_allowed_packet: Max size of packet sent to server in bytes. (default: 16MB)
            Only used to limit size of "LOAD LOCAL INFILE" data packet smaller than default (16KB).
        defer_connect: Don't explicitly connect on contruction - wait for connect call.
            (default: False)
        auth_plugin_map: A dict of plugin names to a class that processes that plugin.
            The class will take the Connection object as the argument to the constructor.
            The class needs an authenticate method taking an authentication packet as
            an argument.  For the dialog plugin, a prompt(echo, prompt) method can be used
            (if no authenticate method) for returning a string from the user. (experimental)
        db: Alias for database. (for compatibility to MySQLdb)
        passwd: Alias for password. (for compatibility to MySQLdb)
